<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Try typing 'doc' at the top of this file and pressing "tab" -->
<!-- if your development environment is set up correctly -->
<!-- the Emmett plugin will set this file up for you -->

<!-- Requirements -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it with an 'action' to /api and a single text field with an id/name of "resto" -->
<!-- If you open /routes/apiRoutes and go to line 38 you will find the server side answer to your request! -->

<!-- This week doesn't have a script.js file in it, because you're focusing on HTML and CSS -->

<!--
    Replace this with your working code from Lab 2, and include:
    - The styles in this folder's `style.css`
    - The script in script.js, which should be included via a `<script src="script.js" >` call before your closing </body> tag
